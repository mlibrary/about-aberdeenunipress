This is an opportunity for researchers at the University to support the development of a community-led Open Access Press. In doing so board members support other researchers to publish accessible research, reach global audiences and help to shape the University’s research culture and environment. 

Serving on the Academic Advisory Board demonstrates a commitment to the principles of Open Research: that research should be accessible and freely available. 

Purpose  

The purpose of the Academic Advisory Board is to approve or reject projects for publication, including proposed monographs, collections, series, and journal titles; to advise the Executive Board on strategic directions, and to liaise with University staff, and the wider academic community; and to maintain the Press’s commitment to the highest standards of research integrity.  In this work, the Academic Advisory Board will look to support 

* the management of the press in line with the University’s Open Research ambitions 
* the development of an inclusive, diverse, and creative portfolio and work environment, supportive of the University’s wider culture of belonging 
* the development of the portfolio of the Press in line the University’s research culture commitments and Aberdeen 2040 strategic plan 

Membership

Terms of Office

Recognition
