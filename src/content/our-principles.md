title: Our Guiding Principles
---
Aberdeen University Press is committed to publishing work of the highest quality. All publications by AUP will undergo a rigorous peer review process by subject experts. Our editors and our reviewers follow the recommended guidelines of the [Committee of Publication Ethics (COPE)](https://publicationethics.org/), in order to make the review process as efficient as possible whilst maintaining a high quality of reviewer feedback.  

We believe that academic research should be open to read and to publish without charge. Our decision to accept a manuscript for publication will be solely based on the outcome of our peer-review process and never on the authorâ€™s ability to pay.

## Our Funding Model
Aberdeen University Press aims to be a Diamond Open Access publisher, with no charges to authors for publication or to readers for accessing our titles. Authors will never be required to pay a fee to publish with us.
