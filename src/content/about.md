title: About Aberdeen University Press
---
Aberdeen University Press was established in 1900, and built a reputation for publishing leading literary and academic works across a range of disciplines. More recently we have focused on journals and monographs covering Scottish culture and history. 

In 2022 we relaunched as a fully Open Access University Press and widened our remit to engage the full range of scholarship, including interdisciplinary work. We publish a range of high-quality peer-reviewed journals, book series and stand-alone monographs. All publishing decisions are made by our Academic Advisory Board.

We aim to be a Diamond Open Access publisher, with no charges to authors for publication or to readers for accessing our titles. Authors will never be required to pay a fee to publish with us. 

Aberdeen University Press is an important component of wider work to expand the University of Aberdeen’s open research capability and support a research culture that encourages openness and aligns with our ambitious long-term strategy, [Aberdeen 2040](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/2040/), which charts the direction of the University for the coming decades.

## Vision and Mission
In line with the University of Aberdeen’s 1495 foundational statement ‘open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others’, we publish high quality open access research across all disciplines and fields of enquiry from scholars worldwide.

As well as publishing primary research, we encourage works of synthesis which are multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary in their approach. Aberdeen University Press is committed to the highest standards of peer review and research integrity, while helping scholars to shape scholarly debate and public policy for national and global challenges.
